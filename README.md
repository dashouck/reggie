# Reggie — Combating Cognitive Bias in Financial Decision-Making with Regime Detection

Reggie is a research project and interactive tool designed to help retail investors recognize **market regime shifts** and avoid common cognitive biases such as panic selling and fear-driven buying.  
It combines **Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)** with well-established **technical indicators** to visualize market states and encourage more disciplined decision-making.

## 🧑‍💻 Code Overview

All code lives in the [`src/`](src) directory:

- **`app.py`** — main entry point, a Dash web app with interactive Plotly charts  
- **`data.py`** — utilities for loading OHLCV data via `Tiingo`, with caching  
- **`regime_change.py`** — Hidden Markov Model–based regime detection  
- **`tech_analysis.py`** — technical indicators (SMA, Bollinger Bands, RSI, Stochastic)  
- **`tickers.txt`** — list of stock tickers for analysis  
- **`quotes.txt`** — inspirational investor quotes used in the UI  

### Flow
1. `data.py` fetches historical market data  
2. `regime_change.py` classifies bull/bear/neutral regimes  
3. `tech_analysis.py` overlays indicators  
4. `app.py` presents interactive dashboards in the browser
